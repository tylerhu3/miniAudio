Summary: Simple music app inspired by facebook chatheads. This utilizes a WindowsLayoutManager to make the music head still in focus on top of other apps, a recyclerview to show the music list, and some notification specific things to keep it in focus. Other than that, it's literally a very simple app that just plays music in the background of all other apps.

Features:  
-Small and Lightweight  
-Plays in the background of all other apps(Other apps cannot silence it)  
-Minimizes to background or chatHead  
-Volume is adjusted independently of device
